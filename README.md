# DelphiCompute
This repository contains Delphi examples on how to initialize and use Compute Shaders from DirectX, in other
words, DirectCompute. These examples have been created with Delphi 10.2 Tokyo, but should be fairly 
compatible with earlier versions.

To compile shaders, execute "compile.bat" from respective folders. Note that this requires "fxc.exe" to be
within system environment path. This can be acomplished by installing Windows SDK and then searching for
that file and then adding it to path.
